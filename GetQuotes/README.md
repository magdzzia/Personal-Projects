# Get Quotes Personal Project

### I am a fan of certain Philosophy books and keep track of their quotes. 
### This program allows me to post these quotes online and not reuse the same quotes. The script checks if a quote has been reused by using the in [file] statement. If the quote is in the used file, it will not be used.
### This is done by importing all the quotes into one .txt file, running the script, and taking those quotes into another .txt file. 

## Lessons Learned:
1. used.seek(0): I learned the .seek() function which allows you to specify while line of text you want the search of the text file to begin from. Since it's in a loop, each new loop will restart at line 0.
