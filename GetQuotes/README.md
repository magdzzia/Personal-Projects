# Get Quotes Personal Project

### I am a fan of certain Philosophy books and keep track of their quotes. 
### This program allows me to post these quotes online and not reuse the same quotes. The script checks if a quote has been reused by using the in [file] statement. If the quote is in the used file, it will not be used.
### This is done by importing all the quotes into one .txt file, running the script, and taking those quotes into another .txt file.
